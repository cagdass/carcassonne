### Short-term plans:

- Encode all tile properties within each unique tile type:
  * Encode each edge
  * Encode where it is possible to place a meeple on the tile
  * Encode where to place a farmer
  * Encode the separation of grass
  * Consider how to represent the semantic difference in the following tiles: 
  * ![alt text][t1]
  * ![alt text][t2]
 
- Checking if two tiles can be placed adjacently
- Automatically place a tile when dropped after having been dragged adjacent to a tile or tiles that it can be placed next to
  
### Mid-term (tbt) plans:

- Add networking

### Long-term plans:

* Do the expansions!

#### Just us things:

* The tiles are named after Swedish (mostly) food-related vocabulary
